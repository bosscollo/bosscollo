# Hi, I'm Collins Boss

I'm a freelance cybersecurity consultant focused on offensive security, bug bounty hunting and penetration testing.  
I enjoy breaking systems ethically to help secure them and building small tools that make recon faster and reporting clearer.

## What I Do
- Penetration Testing (Web apps, APIs, Networks)
- Bug Bounty Hunting (Responsible disclosure)
- Red Team Simulations & Reporting
- Security Awareness & Cyber Hygiene
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

## Featured Projects

### Bug Bounty Recon Toolkit
An internal tool I built to automate parts of the recon workflow

### Freelance Security Testing (2024–Present)
Worked with private clients to test application and infrastructure security.  
Reported vulnerabilities, recommended fixes, and helped teams improve posture.

###  Cybersecurity Talks
Partnered with SMEs & Organizations to deliver digital safety sessions for schools and businesses

I'm all in penetration testing, offensive security or red teaming.
Let’s secure something — or break it first.
